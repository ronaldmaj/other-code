# other-code
Other code that I have written up that does not fit in any other repository at this time

## IRI_data_extraction
Small web scarping script that I wrote up to extract electron density and temperature values from the IRI at 300 km on 01/01/2000 at 1200GMT.
I plan on generalising this to write up a proper function that can be used from the command line and allowing one to choose the profile that one wants data for, such as height or day of the year, etc.
